          <h3>Here's a time line of Swami Vivekananda :</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1863</strong> - Kolkata (earlier Calcutta),india
      </li>
             <li type="a"><strong>1871</strong> - At the age of eight in  Vivekananda was enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Institution and later at the Presidency College in Calcutta. He was exposed to Western philosophy, Christianity, and science. He had an interest in music both instrumental as well as vocal."</li>  
            <li><strong>1880</strong> - He joined Keshab Chandra Sen's Nava Vidhan and also became a member of Sadharan Brahmo Samaj led by Keshab Chandra Sen and Debendranath Tagore."</li>  
            <li><strong>1886</strong> - His guru Shri Ramakrishna gave up his mortal body.</li>  
            <li><strong>1887</strong> -  All the disciples took vows of monkhood and Narendranath emerged as Vivekananda that is "the bliss of discerning wisdom." All of them performed yoga and meditation.</li>  
            <li><strong>1893</strong> - He came upon the stage and stunned everyone while saying "My brothers and sisters of America" at First World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago, America. For this, he received a standing ovation from the audience. He described the principles of Vedanta, their spiritual significance, etc.</li>  
            <li><strong>1897</strong> -  He returned to India and reached Calcutta where he founded Ramakrishna Mission on 1 May, 1897 at Belur Math. The goals of the mission were based on Karma Yoga and its main objective was to serve the poor and suffering or disturbed population of the country.</li>
            <li><strong></strong> Several social services are also performed under this mission like establishing schools, colleges, and hospitals. Teachings of Vedanta were also provided through conferences, seminars, and workshops, rehabilitation work across the country.</li>  
            <li><strong></strong>  Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>  
            <li><strong></strong>  Narendra was trained in Indian classical music,[27] and regularly participated in physical exercise, sports and organised activities. Narendra studied Western logic, Western philosophy and European history at the General Assembly's Institution (now known as the Scottish Church College).[28] In 1881, he passed the Fine Arts examination, and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884.[29][30] Narendra studied the works of David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Baruch Spinoza, Georg W. F. Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, Auguste Comte, John Stuart Mill and Charles Darwin.</li>
      </li>  
            <li><strong></strong>  He became fascinated with the evolutionism of Herbert Spencer and corresponded with him,[33][34] translating Herbert Herbert Spencer's book Education (1861) into Bengali.[35] While studying Western philosophers, he also learned Sanskrit scriptures and Bengali literature.</li>  
            <li><strong></strong>  Narendra was known for his prodigious memory and the ability at speed reading. Several incidents have been given as examples. In a talk, he once quoted verbatim, two or three pages from Pickwick Papers.</li>  
            <li><strong></strong> Another incident that is given is his argument with a Swedish national where he gave reference to some details on Swedish history that the Swede originally disagreed with but later conceded. In another incident with Dr. Paul Deussen's at Kiel in Germany, Vivekananda was going over some poetical work and did not reply when the professor spoke to him. Later, he apologised to Dr. Deussen explaining that he was too absorbed in reading and hence did not hear him. The professor was not satisfied with this explanation but Vivekananda quoted and interpreted verses from the text leaving the professor dumbfounded about his feat of memory. Once, he requested some books written by Sir John Lubbock from a library and returned them the very next day claiming that he had read them. The librarian refused to believe him until cross examination about the contents convinced him that Vivekananda was being truthful.[37]
      </li>  
            <li><strong></strong> Vivekananda started his journey to the West on 31 May 1893[87] and visited several cities in Japan (including Nagasaki, Kobe, Yokohama, Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo),[88] China and Canada en route to the United States,[87] reaching Chicago on 30 July 1893,[89][87] where the "Parliament of Religions" took place in September 1893.[90]</li>  
            <li><strong></strong> After a brief visit to the Advaita Ashrama in Mayavati, Vivekananda settled at Belur Math, where he continued co-ordinating the works of Ramakrishna Mission, the math and the work in England and the US. He had many visitors, including royalty and politicians. Although Vivekananda was unable to attend the Congress of Religions in 1901 in Japan due to deteriorating health, he made pilgrimages to Bodhgaya and Varanasi.[154] Declining health (including asthma, diabetes and chronic insomnia) restricted his activity.[155]</li>  
            <li><strong>1902</strong> - He died while doing meditation at the age 40. He is said to have attained 'Mahasamadhi' and was cremated on the Banks of the river Ganga.</li>
